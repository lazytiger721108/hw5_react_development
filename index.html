            <p style="color:#050000;text-align: center;">This project provides me with a chance to
                learn more about the web dev process. The difference from the previous projects is that
                in the past more emphasis was placed on thinking as a designer, but this time in the project
                we can be more comfortable with "development", especially some popular front-end frameworks
                and libraries, such as React. For a designer, the ability to develop is also very important.
                Specifically, I chose to implement an online bookstore, and the data is Amazon Book Data.</p>

                                Regarding the layout of the web page, from left to right are the side bar
                                (including sort and filter), product list and shopping cart, which
                                areconsistent with conventional shopping websites.

                                shopping carts,etc. For each feature, I have marked its function very
                                clearly to ensure that users can quickly understand its meaning.

                            <p>Regarding <b>User control and freedom</b>, as a designer, we must consider
                                users oftenperform actions by mistake, so I need to design a function
                                that allows users to return to the initial product list without
                                changing the current shopping cart. I implemented a "Reset" function,
                                which is placed in the side bar, users can quickly clear the settings
                                of sort and filter without changing the shopping cart. When we provide
                                a quick way to back out of a process or undo an action, it strengthens
                                the user's sense of freedom and confidence.

                    sort + two features, and after sorting, add two products to the shopping cart and
                    then reset to check whether each function works properly.

            First of all, I must say that although I used React for web dev a few years ago, this project is a good
            opportunity for me to review React. I checked many online implementations, and even used my previous
            MERN-stack project as a reference to solve bugs in development. I've thought about using redux, but
            overkilling a problem is never a good idea. During this process, I learned a lesson. For the knowledge and
            technology I have learned, especially those that are still very popular and useful today, I must review and
            practice them frequently. At the same time, from the designer's point of view, this project is also a good
            opportunity for me to review the Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design learned in class.
        </p>
        <p class="lorem_text">
            If I have time, I hope to further design and implement the details page of each product, and connect a
            backend to this website, which can allow users to do more operations. Regarding user testing, I will put my
            website on user testing service to collect feedback and constantly optimize my front-end design.
